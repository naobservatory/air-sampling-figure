# Data and code to recreate Figure 1 from "Indoor Air Sampling for Detection of Viral Nucleic Acids"

Welcome to the repository for "Indoor Air Sampling for Detection of Viral Nucleic Acids". This repository houses data and Python code necessary to recreate Figure 1 featured in our publication.

The data for Figure 1A was extracted from Figure 6 in [Bagheri et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2022.106102) "Size, concentration, and origin of human exhaled particles and their dependence on human factors with implications on infection transmission".
